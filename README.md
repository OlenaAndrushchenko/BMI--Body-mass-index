# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

A program is desired to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person. To do this, we need to define the person's weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). The Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated using the following formula:

BMI = weight / height2

Then, based on the BMI obtained, we can determine if a person has normal weight, underweight, overweight, or obesity. To generate these results, the calculated BMI must fall within certain ranges as per the table (see attached document).

### Requirements:
- There is no need to generate output via terminal.
- Unit testing is mandatory.
